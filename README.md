## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
* **API:** Google Gemini API (`@google/generative-ai`)

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or later)
* A Google Gemini API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git)
    cd YourRepositoryName
    ```

2.  **Install the necessary packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create an environment file:** Create a new file in the root of your project named `.env`.

4.  **Add your API key:** Add your Google Gemini API key to the `.env` file like this:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

5.  **Create a `.gitignore` file:** To ensure your secret API key is never pushed to GitHub, create a file named `.gitignore` in the root of your project and add the following line to it:
    ```
    .env
    ```

6.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## üîß Usage

1.  Once the server is running, open your web browser.
2.  Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your project).
3.  Type a prompt in the input box and press Enter to start a conversation with the AI assistant.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

* Implement user accounts and chat history.
* Add the ability to switch between different Gemini models.
* Incorporate voice input and text-to-speech for responses.
